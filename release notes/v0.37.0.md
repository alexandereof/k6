k6 v0.37.0 is here! ðŸŽ‰ Mainly it contains fixes and ongoing efforts with refactoring.

## New Features!

### Added an option to output k6 logs to a file through --log-output ([#2285](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2285))

This is on top of the supported stdout/stderr and loki instance.

The feature speaks for itself with examples of usage:

```sh
k6 run --log-output file=./k6.log --logformat json ./examples/stages.js
```

with a defined minimal log level:

```sh
k6 run --log-output file=./k6.log,level=info --logformat json ./examples/stages.js
```

Thanks, @[alyakimenko](https://github.com/alyakimenko) for the contribution!

### Added experimental basic event loops ([#882](https://github.com/grafana/k6/issues/882))

We added basic event loop functionality ([#2228](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2228) and [#2373](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2373)). This is a first step and currently isn't used by anything, but is now available to extensions. In following releases this will be used by k6 and will mean that some APIs will start having callbacks or return Promises. But first it's likely that it will be used in some experimental extensions.

If you are an extension developer please use it and give your feedback. But take into consideration that it's likely that the API may change.

## Extensions

`v0.37.0` finalizes ([#2376](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2376) and [#2384](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2384)) the switching of our internal modules to [a new Go/JavaScript module API](https://k6.io/docs/extensions/guides/create-an-extension/#advanced-javascript-extension). As the last internal the GRPC module was refactored ([#2365](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2365)).

It's important to highlight that the old API is deprecated and will be removed in the next k6's release (`v0.38.0`). Every extension that isn't using that API will get a warning message, like:

```sh
WARN[0000] Module 'k6/x/sql' is using deprecated APIs that will be removed in k6 v0.38.0, for more details on how to update it see https://k6.io/docs/extensions/guides/create-an-extension/#advanced-javascript-extension
```

We did migrations for some xk6 extensions (see connected issues to the task [#2344](https://github.com/grafana/k6/issues/2344)). The pull requests can serve as examples on how to transition your extension to the new API.

## Docker Repository

We migrated our Docker Hub's repository from `loadimpact/k6` to [grafana/k6](https://hub.docker.com/r/grafana/k6) ([#2377](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2377)).

```sh
docker run -i grafana/k6 run - <script.js
```

We continue pushing the images to the `loadimpact/k6` for some time, but if you use it in your local or CI environments please plan the migration.

## Enhancements and UX improvements

- We continued work on the source map feature: add samples ([#2339](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2339)) and improve loading and parsing ([#2355](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2355)).
- Updated installation from source instructions ([#2359](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2359)). Thanks, @[karitham](https://github.com/Karitham), for making the change.
- Introduced Go-based thresholds parsing ([#2400](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2400)).
- Enabled more TC39 tests: [optional-chaining](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Optional_chaining) ([#2338](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2338)) and async ([#2396](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2396)).
- We updated our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/grafana/k6/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and a few GitHub URLs ([#2416](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2416)).

## Bugs fixed!

- [`http.head`](https://k6.io/docs/javascript-api/k6-http/head-url-params/) started taking a body as a second argument ([#2402](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2402)) by mistake in v0.36.0. It is now back to its old signature `http.head(url, [params])`.
- Fixed [options.scenarios'](https://k6.io/docs/using-k6/options/#scenarios) JSON marshaling ([#2392](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2392)).
- Metrics' names display again in k6's Rest API ([#2421](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2421)).
- We improved misconfiguration detection for [`check`](https://k6.io/docs/javascript-api/k6/check-val-sets-tags)([#2387](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2387)), [`http.batch`](https://k6.io/docs/javascript-api/k6-http/batch-requests)([#2415](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2415)) and [metrics' constructors](https://k6.io/docs/javascript-api/k6-metrics/) ([#2427](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2427)).

## Internals

- We updated our CI to improve developer experience. Dependency and linter checks now run only for pull requests ([#2403](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2403)).
- This release also contains a few refactoring PRs that fix linters errors ([#2334](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2334), [#2331](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2331) and [#2341](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2341)), remove global variable usage ([#2336](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2336), [#2358](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2358), [#2353](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2353) and [#2357](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2357)) and remove an unnecessary dependency ([#2313](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2313)) which makes our codebase more consistent and maintainable.
- The `headers` parameter in k6's GRPC module is marked as deprecated ([#2370](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2370)).
- Switched `envconfig` to our own fork ([#2337](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2337)) in order to abstract the `os` package and improve testability.
